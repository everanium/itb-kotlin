# One-step build for the Kotlin binding: libitb3.so + JNI shim + Java
# binding jar (via the sibling bindings/java/build.sh), then the Kotlin
# classes + eitb jar via Gradle. Prerequisites (Go, JDK 17+, Gradle,
# Kotlin, gcc) must be installed separately; see README.md
# "Prerequisites" section.
#
# The build starts from an empty tree: the Gradle build directory, the
# project-local Gradle and Kotlin caches and stray class output are
# removed first, so no output can survive from an earlier invocation.
#
# The Java binding layer is a shared producer, not something this
# binding owns, so it is never deleted from here: bindings/java/build.sh
# is invoked instead and performs its own clean, which is what
# guarantees the JNI shim and the `libitb3-java-*.jar` this binding
# resolves are both current. Running that producer build first also
# means the shim is in place before any Kotlin code loads it.
#
# Set ITB_SKIP_CLEAN=1 to keep the existing artefacts and build
# incrementally; it propagates to the Java layer as well. With no
# environment set the wipe always runs.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh             # default build (full asm stack)
#   ./build.sh --noitbasm  # opt out of ITB's SIMD asm kernels

# Every removal is logged before it happens, and a failing rm aborts
