# One-step test runner for the Kotlin binding. Builds libitb3.so + the
# JNI shim + the Java binding jar + the Kotlin classes via build.sh,
# then invokes the JUnit 5 suite through Gradle. Positional arguments
# are forwarded straight to Gradle (e.g. `./run_tests.sh --tests
# '*SmokeTest'`).
#
# build.sh wipes this binding's build tree and delegates the Java
# layer to bindings/java/build.sh, which cleans its own, so the classes
# exercised here are always compiled by this invocation. Set
# ITB_SKIP_CLEAN=1 to keep the existing artefacts and compile
# incrementally instead.
